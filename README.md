A streamlined environment management tool for PHP developers.

Loom Spinner makes it easy to launch minimal, thoughtfully pre-configured Docker containers for PHP development; helping 
you enjoy a fast, consistent, and hassle-free workflow.

Run simple commands from anywhere on your system to manage your environments.

# At a Glance

Effortlessly create custom Docker environments for each of your PHP projects. Out of the box, Loom Spinner provides:

- **PHP 8.4** (includes XDebug & OpCache)
- **Nginx**
- **MySQL 9.3**
- **NodeJS 23** (Node, NPM, & NPX)

Your project directory is automatically mounted to the PHP container, and the `public` directory is served via Nginx at 
`http://localhost:<nginx-port>`. Access the container directly from your terminal to execute unit tests or other 
commands, all within an isolated environment.

# Installation

**Requirements:**
- Composer
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine

To install globally, run:

```shell
composer global require cloudbase/loom-spinner
```

# Usage

Start Docker, then launch your project environment:

```shell
cd /path/to/my-project
loom spin:up my-project .
```

Check which ports your containers are using via Docker Desktop or by running `docker ps`.

Once running, your project's public directory is accessible at `http://localhost:<nginx-container-port>`â€”you're ready to go!

## Managing Your Environment

To stop your containers:

```shell
loom spin:stop my-project
```

To start them again:

```shell
loom spin:start my-project
```

To attach to your PHP container:

```shell
loom spin:attach my-project
```

To remove them completely:

```shell
loom spin:down my-project
```

To list all of your _Spinner_ managed environments:

```shell
loom env:list
```

Loom Spinner can be further customized with a set of simple configuration options.

Happy spinning! ðŸ§µ
